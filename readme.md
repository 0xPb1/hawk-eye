# HermesGuard - Detect PII data from multiple sources

HermesGuard is a powerful and extensible CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool designed to enhance data source security by detecting and protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) across various platforms like S3, MySQL, Redis, and Firebase. Inspired by the cunning and swift messenger of the gods in Greek mythology, HermesGuard aims to efficiently navigate through different data sources and provide real-time protection against potential data breaches and vulnerabilities.

### Why "HermesGuard"?
The name "HermesGuard" is derived from the Greek god Hermes, known for his role as the messenger of the gods and protector of travelers and shepherds. He was characterized by his speed, cleverness, and guidance. These attributes align perfectly with the objectives of the HermesGuard project: swift identification of potential data leaks and cleverly safeguarding sensitive information across multiple data sources.

Just as Hermes served as a watchful guardian, HermesGuard strives to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and breaches, ensuring the security and privacy of users' data.

## Usage
To use HermesGuard, follow the steps mentioned in the "Usage" section of the "README.md" file.
